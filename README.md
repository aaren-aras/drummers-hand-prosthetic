# Drummer's Hand Prosthetic 
Welcome! 

Our EMG-powered hand prosthetic is designed to empower amputee musicians, particularly drummers, with a tool to enhance their musical expression and performance. By harnessing the strength of their forearm flex, this technology enables drummers to control the movement of a drumstick. At the core lies an electromyography (EMG) system that detects and interprets the electrical signals generated by the drummer's forearm muscles. These signals are then translated into motor commands for the prosthetic hand, enabling proportional control of the drumstick's distance from the striking surface. We then employed additive manufacturing in the form of 3D printing to materialize our digital design into a tangible and functional prototype. This enabled rapid iteration for fine-tuning the prosthetic's form and function efficiently.
