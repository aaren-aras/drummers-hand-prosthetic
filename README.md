# Drummer's Hand Prosthetic 
Welcome! Our EMG-powered hand prosthetic is designed to empower musicians, particularly drummers, with a tool to enhance their musical expression and performance. By harnessing the strength of their forearm flex, this technology enables drummers to control the movement of a drumstick. At the core lies an electromyography (EMG) system that detects and interprets the electrical signals generated by the drummer's forearm muscles. These signals are then translated into motor commands for the prosthetic hand, enabling proportional control of the drumstick's distance from the striking surface. We then employed additive manufacturing in the form of 3D printing to materialize our digital design into a tangible and functional prototype. This enabled rapid iteration for fine-tuning the prosthetic's form and function efficiently.


Features
Precise EMG Control: The hand prosthetic is finely tuned to respond to EMG signals from users' forearm muscles, enabling intuitive control and natural movement.

Unified Active Breadboard Circuit: The circuit incorporates an Arduino Uno and HS-645MG servo, creating a seamless interface between the prosthetic and the user.

Signal Enhancement: The EMG signals undergo a series of enhancements, including noise reduction (30% reduction), half-wave rectification, and integration using dual LM358 op-amps.

3D Printed Components: The prosthetic features a set of 3D printed components, including an arm sleeve, servo base, and stick holder. These components are fabricated using ABS material with a 15% infill, ensuring durability without compromising flexibility.
